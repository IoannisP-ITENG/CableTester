### PCB

The first step is to order the printed circuit boards (PCBs).

Most of the time a PCB manufacturer expexts a .zip file from you containing so called *gerber* files. These files are describing your PCB design in a way that it's understandable by the software the machines in the factory use.

The latest gerber file package can be found [here#TODO]() as `gerber.zip`.

See the `readme.md` file included in the realease package for specific order instructions.

Some common PCB manufacturers:

- [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)
- [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/)
- [Multi CB](https://www.multi-circuit-boards.eu/)
- [Eurocircuits](https://www.eurocircuits.com/)

### Components

The components you need can be ordered from different sources. Here are some suggestions:

- [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/)
- [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/)
- [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/)
- [Thonk](https://www.thonk.co.uk/)

Some stores allow you to upload the `bom.csv` direcly, other you must search the components manually.
